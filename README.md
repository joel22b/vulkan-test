Test repo for learning Vulkan and testing out features with it.

This is based off the guide at [https://vkguide.dev/](https://vkguide.dev/)

This requires the Vulkan SDK to be installed in order to build. Installation instructions can be found [here](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home). I am using version 1.4.335.0
